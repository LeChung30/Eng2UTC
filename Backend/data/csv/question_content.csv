Dad said there was one in 1977 and he still remembers it well. Everyone loved it! I couldn’t believe that since 1977 they never had another one. If it was so good, why not do it again? We started to organise it, together with some other people. I helped to make the web page, so everyone on the street knew about the party and could post their old photos from the party in 1977. There were some pictures of my dad when he was a kid, together with his friends, who have moved away from the street now. It was interesting to see that the buildings on the street haven’t changed at all! My mum was a bit worried about the party. ‘But a lot of people on the street don’t really know each other’, she said. ‘What if they don’t have anything to talk about?’ I just said, ‘Relax, Mum. It’ll be great.’ So, what was the party like? It was fantastic! My friends and I really liked speaking to an old lady called Louisa. She’s 89 and was telling us about when she and her friends were our age. So now I always chat to her when I see her on the street. I didn’t know who she was before, so I’m glad we had the party.",,

She and the other members share a flat in Seoul’s business district. Since they all left school, they have managed to make playing video games their life. Everyday, Seo-yun gets up after a good night’s sleep at 10 a.m. and goes for a jog for an hour, before sitting down at her computer and starting to play. She and her friends have a few breaks to eat and relax during the day and the evening, but Seo-yun thinks that after midnight is when she has more fun playing than at any other time. She usually goes to bed at 3 a.m. Seo-yun and the rest of the team need to train hard and keep fit, as top players need to do about 30 mouse-clicks a minute. Video games are big business in South Korea, and the best players (like KS Fireflies 6) usually become even better-known than top baseball or volleyball players. Some people might get bored after playing video games for an hour or two. But these guys are actually getting paid to do something they love as a job. Many of them would even like to do it for free!",,

Henrietta heard she had won the prize at a dinner in London last night. ‘I can’t believe I won the title!’ Henrietta said when she found out. ‘There are hundreds of good, hard-working businesspeople out there, so when people tell you that you’re the best it’s just fantastic.’ Henrietta runs three companies that make food and drink to sell to hotels and restaurants in and around her hometown. ‘I couldn’t have done it without my parents and husband. They’ve given me a lot of help,’ Henrietta said. Henrietta’s mother was also a successful businessperson and taught her daughter that anything is possible if you work hard. Henrietta is also lucky because her husband, Pete, put his own career on hold to look after their two young children. Henrietta is the first woman to win the title. Last year’s winner, Tom Lawson, who runs a successful tourism company, was at the dinner too. ‘The competition is an important way to get people interested in starting their own businesses,’ he told the audience. ‘Of course, not everyone wants to do it, but you don’t need to come from a rich family to be a successful businessperson.’ Henrietta could one day be a rich woman. But she isn’t one yet; the money she makes goes back into her businesses, not into her pocket.",,

I was amazed by it. I asked my dad if I could play a game on it. He said, ‘No, you can’t play games on this computer. It’s for work.’ I was disappointed. But then he showed me how to write a letter on it. I wrote a letter to my friend and printed it out. I was so happy! I showed it to my mum and dad. They were very proud of me. I was proud of myself too. I thought, ‘I can write letters on a computer!’ I wrote letters to my friends and family all the time. I loved it. I still do. I’m 15 now and I have my own computer. I use it for schoolwork and to write stories. I also use it to chat to my friends. I love my computer. I can’t imagine life without it.",,
